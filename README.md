# CancerDiagnosis-ANN-PSO

## Project Overview
This repository contains a cancer diagnosis system that leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The project focuses on classifying breast cancer based on a set of features, aiming to assist in early detection and treatment planning.

## Background
Breast cancer is a prevalent disease with significant impact on health. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Features
- Use of ANN for accurate classification of cancerous conditions.
- Optimization of ANN using PSO for enhanced performance.
- Analysis of various features to determine cancer presence and type.

## Dataset
